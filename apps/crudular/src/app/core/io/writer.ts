// Writer is the interface that wraps the basic Write method.
//
// Write writes len(p) bytes from p to the underlying data stream.
// It returns the number of bytes written from p (0 <= n <= len(p))
// and any error encountered that caused the write to stop early.
// Write must return a non-nil error if it returns n < len(p).
// Write must not modify the slice data, even temporarily.
//
// Implementations must not retain p.
export interface Writer {
  write(p: Uint8Array): [n: number, err: Error | null];
